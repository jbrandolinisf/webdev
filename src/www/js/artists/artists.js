// In the index.html file there is a button.  When the button is
// clicked kick off an HTTP GET request to the following URL:
//
//   /api/artists
//
// The response text will be a JSON-encoded array of objects.  Inspect
// the response using the browser debugger and then insert the objects
// into the DOM.  Each artist in the response should be used to create
// a new <li> element in the existing <ul> container (the one with the
// ID of "artists").  Display the name of each artist inside the newly
// created <li> elements.
//
//
// BONUS #1:
//
// We want to display a loading indicator when the user clicks the button.
// The SemanticUI Style Library has a class that displays a loading "spinner".
//
// Make it so that when the button is clicked, a class of "loading" is added
// to the button element's class list
// And, after the content is loaded, the "loading" class is removed.
//
// BONUS #2:
//
// Clicking one of the <li> elements should display all information
// about the clicked artist in the <ul> with the ID of "details".
// (Hint: make another HTTP request to /api/artists/N where N is the
// artist ID.)
//
// BONUS #3:
//
// After displaying a list of artist details, also display a list of
// album names.  A list of albums can be fetched using the following
// URL:
//     /api/artists/N/albums
//
